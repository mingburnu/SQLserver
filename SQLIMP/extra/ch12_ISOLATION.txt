SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL 
    { READ COMMITTED 
        | READ UNCOMMITTED 
        | REPEATABLE READ 
        | SERIALIZABLE 
    }

READ COMMITTED(讀取認可)
  Specifies that shared locks are held while the data is being read to avoid dirty reads,
  but the data can be changed before the end of the transaction, resulting in nonrepeatable reads or phantom data. 
  This option is the SQL Server default.

READ UNCOMMITTED(讀取未認可)
  Implements dirty read, or isolation level 0 locking, which means that no shared locks are issued and 
  no exclusive locks are honored. When this option is set, it is possible to read uncommitted or dirty data;
  values in the data can be changed and rows can appear or disappear in the data set before the end of the
  transaction. This option has the same effect as setting NOLOCK on all tables in all SELECT statements in a
  transaction. This is the least restrictive of the four isolation levels.

REPEATABLE READ(可重覆讀取)
  Locks are placed on all data that is used in a query, preventing other users from updating the data, 
  but new phantom rows can be inserted into the data set by another user and are included in later reads in
  the current transaction. Because concurrency is lower than the default isolation level, use this option only
  when necessary.

SERIALIZABLE(可序列化)
  Places a range lock on the data set, preventing other users from updating or inserting rows into the
  data set until the transaction is complete. This is the most restrictive of the four isolation levels. 
  Because concurrency is lower, use this option only when necessary. This option has the same effect as 
  setting HOLDLOCK on all tables in all SELECT statements in a transaction.

--Session 1-----------------------------------------------------------

create table t1(id int)
go

begin transaction
 insert into t1 values(334)
go

--先不要 commit

select * from t1


--Session 2
select * from t1
go

會 hold住 除非 

set transaction isolation level read uncommitted
go

select * from t1
go


--Session 1
commit
go

select * from t1


--Session 1

SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ  --表示 其它人不可刪除查詢範圍中資料 但可新增

SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL  SERIALIZABLE   --表示 其它人不可刪除查詢範圍中資料 也不可新增
